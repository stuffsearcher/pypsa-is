Data is provided by Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen (BASt).
Hourly data for passenger cars from 2010-2015 was used.
Data gives the number of counted vehicles in a given hour.
Day $0$ refers to Monday, day $1$ to Tuesday etc.
Hour $0$ gives the number of vehicles counted between 0 a.m. and 1 a.m., hour $1$ between $1$ a.m. and $2$ a.m. and so on.
Only measurements marked as ``on a regular base'' were considered.
