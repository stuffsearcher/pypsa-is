-- simplify_network,,,
-- -- to_substations,bool,"true/false","Aggregates all nodes without power injection (positive or negative, i.e. demand or generation) to electrically closest ones"
-- -- algorithm,str,"One of {‘kmeans’, ‘hac’, ‘modularity‘}}","Clustering algorithm"
-- -- feature,str,"Str in the format ‘carrier1+carrier2+...+carrierN-X’, where CarrierI can be from {‘solar’, ‘onwind’, ‘offwind’, ‘ror’} and X is one of {‘cap’, ‘time’}.","Is used for hierarchical clustering"
