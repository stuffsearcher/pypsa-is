Monte Carlo

The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that involves running
multiple simulations with randomly sampled input parameters to estimate
the distribution of the output variables.

In Africa, navigating decision-making amidst rapid demand growth and
substantial infrastructure changes poses a significant challenge. To
tackle this uncertainty, the Monte Carlo method can be employed to
construct a stochastic interpretation of deterministic model scenarios.
This approach enhances the ability to account for variability and assess
potential outcomes, providing a more robust foundation for informed
decision-making.

To use the Monte-Carlo method in PyPSA-Earth, you have to activate the
``monte_carlo`` option in the configuration file (``config.yaml``),
set ``add_to_snakefile`` to true in the monte_carlo section. This will
enable the monte-carlo method.

There are a few additional options that needs to be set in the monte_carlo
configuration options.

Set ``options``
----------------
- ``samples``: The number of samples to be used in the monte-carlo simulation.
- ``samppling_strategy``: The method used to sample the input parameters. Either of ``pydoe2``, ``chaospy``, or ``scipy``.
- ``seed``: The seed for the random number generator. It is useful to set the seed to a fixed value to ensure reproducibility of the results.

Set ``uncertainties``
---------------------
The ``uncertainties`` section in the configuration file is used to specify the
parameters to be sampled in the monte-carlo simulation. The uncertainties
section is a dictionary with the keys being the ``pypsa object value`` to be
sampled and the values split into ``type`` and ``args`` of which ``type`` is used to
select the distribution and ``args`` used to specify the parameters of the selected
distribution type.

The following is an example of the uncertainties section in the configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

    uncertainties:
        loads_t.p_set:
          type: uniform
          args: [0, 1]
        generators_t.p_max_pu.loc[:, n.generators.carrier == "onwind"]:
          type: lognormal
          args: [1.5]
        generators_t.p_max_pu.loc[:, n.generators.carrier == "solar"]:
          type: beta
          args: [0.5, 2]

.. note::
    To understand the different distribution types and their parameters,
    check `Scipy Documentation <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html>`_

.. tip::
    To create reallistic uncertainties, it is important to pay attention to
    the distribution that is being applied to each ``pypsa object parameter``.

Workflow
--------

To perform a dry-run of the monte-carlo simulation after setting the config options, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 solve_all_networks_monte -n

To create a DAG of the monte-carlo simulation workflow, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 solve_all_networks_monte --dag | dot -Tpng > monte_carlo_workflow.png

.. image:: img/monte_carlo_workflow.png
    :align: center

The monte-carlo simulation can be run using the following rule:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 solve_all_networks_monte

.. note::
    Increasing the number of cores can make the process run faster. The numbers of cores can be increased by
    setting the ``-j`` option to the desired number of cores.
